	<p><font size="3">Self-taught developer from San Francisco, CA. Earned a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. Received a Ruby on Rails certification through OMR. Also certified as a Quality Improvement Associate through ASQ. Have a wide range of expierence in Business Development and Project Management. 
	<p>Innovative, strategic, and results-driven. Love working with startups and entrepreneurs, saw a need for more developers, decided to learn programming. Spend long hours honing my skills. Eventually created this app - not the first of its kind, but it was built in 2 weeks. 
	<p>Believe that success comes from hard work and a positive attitude. If you never take risks, youâ€™ll never move forward.</p>
